<p>Using the line tool create a 1 inch vertical black line with a 1pt stroke.</p>
<p>Then create a 1 inch horizontal black line with a 1pt stroke. Make this line connect at the bottom of the vertical line to create an ‘L’ shape.</p>

<p>The top of the second line will be parallel to the other but sit .16in to the left.</p>
<p>Lastly create one more horizontal black line.</p>
<p>This line will sit .13in below the first horizontal line.</p>
<p>The start of the line should connect to the vertical line that sits .16in away from the other.</P></h1>
